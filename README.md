# netFlow
A simple network flow optimisation in Python using the Pyomo optimisation library created for a National Infrastructure Commission study. Requires standard scientific libraries such as numpy and pandas (all available in the Anaconda Distribution). The Pyomo package is installed with the default GLPK solver. However, the Gurobi solver is recommended, which is freely available to academics.
